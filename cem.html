    <h2>Description</h2>
    <article>
      <p>For the past semester, I have been taking a class called Intermediate Electronic Media Production.  We have had a few small projects, including a PSA and a sports package.  We also worked with the University of Miami’s TV station, UMTV.  For the duration of the class, I was the assistant director of UMTV’s weekly half-hour newscast, NewsVision.</p>
      <p>The entire semester, I worked with some of my classmates on a 30-minute documentary entitled Catch-22: Autism in Adulthood.  The documentary focuses on the challenges that autistic individuals face after they turn 22, when the government pulls funding for public education.  We interviewed several families of autistic adults, the University of Miami Center for Autism and Related Disabilities (UM CARD) (link??), and others involved with providing services or jobs to autistic adults.  Some of our shoots required us to travel an hour or more away from campus.  Once we compiled our footage, we finalized a script and used the computer program Avid to edit our clips into a comprehensive documentary.  We worked with a composer, who scored the entire piece with original music.</p>
      <p>My role in the documentary group was the social media coordinator.  I maintained an online presence for our movie, which included photographing and posting updates about our shoots.</p>
